# Tmux ACPI

This `tmux` plugin represents `acpi` information available on your status bar.

### Battery Status & Percentage

Battery status indicator can be either of `Discharing`, `Charging`, and `Not
Charging` values.

Battery percentage indicator shows the charged capacity of your battery in
percentage from 0 to 100. Of course you will never witness the 0 percent of
your battery, not even with time travel.

### Battery Capacity & Health

Battery capacity indicator shows the last full charged capacity value of your
battery. Note that this has nothing to do with how much time the adapter was
connected to your laptop, this is the capacity that is functional! Yes we are
all screwed and we don't know it until we see how much capacity is gone.
There's not much on seeing dead cells of your battery unless you want to suffer
witnessing your battery going down on a daily basis.

### Thermal Status

This indicator shows the tempraturue of your device. It could be cold, hot or
reach its critical temprature where you should ask yourself what the heck are
you doing to your device.

### AC-Adapter Status
